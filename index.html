      Arcadecord is a Discord bot that lets you play many games inside text
      channels including classics like 8 Ball, Cup Pong, Chess, and more. You
      can simply add the bot to your server and type /play to play.

      Note: A sincere thanks to all of those who have played and supported
      Arcadecord. You have made the 10 months we've spent working on it worth
      it. So it saddens us to announce that the official Arcadecord bot is being
      shut down because at this time we don't have enough people or money to
      keep working on the project. We're deeply apologize for the inconvenience.
      <b
        >However, we are working on converting it to an open source project so
        that anyone can run and contribute to Arcadecord for free. This will
        allow Arcadecord to run on more servers and for more fun games to be
        added.</b
